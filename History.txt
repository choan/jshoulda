== 1.1 2008-11-09

* jShoulda is now a global symbol
* Refactored code to allow simple aliasing
* Aliasing methods jShoulda.setShouldAlias and jShoulda.setContextAlias
* Configurable connector deprecated (and removed) in favor of jShoulda.setShouldAlias method.
* global methods `should` and `context` are now created through aliasing
* Try this, babe

    jShoulda.setContextAlias('describe').setShouldAlias('it', '');
    describe("A context", {},
      it("runs tests", function() {
        this.assert(true);
      })
    )();

* The configuration object (setup/teardown) is now optional
* before/after are documented alias to setup/teardown since this very moment.
